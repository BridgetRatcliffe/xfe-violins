# xfe-violins
Violin plots of [X/Fe] for the inner disk (3-5 kpc), solar neighborhood (7-9 kpc), and outer disk (11-13 kpc) for [Fe/H]-[Mg/Fe] chemical cells. These figures are more in-depth than Figures 7 and 8 in Ratcliffe & Ness 2022 (https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2023ApJ...943...92R/abstract), showing the units for [Fe/H], [Mg/Fe], and [X/Fe].
